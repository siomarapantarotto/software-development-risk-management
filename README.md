This repo outlines some aspects of risk governance in software development projects.

Be welcome to copy, modify, and apply them in your own work or business, as well as share them with whomever you consider necessary. 

## Introduction

Risk control is vital to software development projects.

A project can be defined as a work that seeks the creation of a product or the execution of a service.

Whether it is a product or a service, all activities need to be planned, scheduled, and, when executed, need to be controlled.

Incorporate risk management in the software development process, evaluate the results and propose improvements to the plan is an important factor for the success or failure of any project.

## Risk Control Objectives

Operate in a preventive way, acting actively to reduce risks that are present in software development projects by identifying, analyzing, treating, and controlling them.

## Expected Results

- Improvement of the products and services developed.

- Increased productivity of the product development process.

- Deliveries on schedule.

- Reduction of losses.

- etc...

## Risk Management Process

- **Communication and consultation**

    // TODO: define ways of communication and consultation

- **Establishing the context** 

    // TODO: define contexts
    
- **Risk identification**

    // TODO: describe risks
    
- **Risk analysis**
  
   - **Probability:**
  
      - **VERY LOW**:   Unlikely. The event may even occur in exceptional situations, but the circumstances do not indicate this possibility.
      - **LOW**:        Rare. The event may occur unexpectedly or casually, as the circumstances indicate little of this possibility.
      - **MEDIUM**:     Possible. Event could occur in some way because circumstances moderately indicate this possibility.
      - **HIGH**:       Probable. The event can occur in an even expected way because circumstances strongly indicate this possibility.
      - **VERY HIGH**:  Almost certain. The event will certainly occur because the circumstances clearly indicate this possibility.

  - **Impact:**
  
      - **VERY LOW**: minimally compromises the achievement of the objective; for practical purposes, does not alter the achievement of the objective/result.
      - **LOW**: compromises the achievement of the objective to some extent, but does not prevent the achievement of most of the objective/result.
      - **MEDIUM**: reasonably compromises the achievement of the goal/outcome.
      - **HIGH**: Compromises most of the achievement of the objective/result.
      - **VERY HIGH**: totally or almost totally compromises the achievement of the of the objective/result.

- **Risk assessment**

  Risk assessment is the process of identifying potential hazards and analyzing what might happen if they occur.
    
- **Risk treatment**
  
  The market presents countless tools and services for risk control and treatment, but the truth is that not all companies can afford them.

  It is also true that many companies experiencing growth, with little or no profit, are unlikely to stop investing in their primary activities in order to invest in risk control.

  It is the reality of each company that will define if risk control will be delegated to specialists or implemented by its own members through the development and execution of an action plan, which can be immediate or preventive.

  These are actions already thought out, discussed, and assigned to the risk, even if the risk has never occurred. This is not an exhaustive list, because new actions may be suggested at any moment. Hence the importance of the constant revision of the risk management plan.    

    - **Immediate actions:** These are actions that should be implemented immediately when the risk occurs. 
  
    - **Preventive actions:** These are actions that should be constantly implemented aiming at the prevention of risk occurrence.
    
- Monitoring and critical analysis

    The revision of the risk treatment plan is fundamental because even if a risk does not present immediate or preventive actions at a certain moment does not mean that it will not present them at another moment. 

    
## Risks

## Misunderstood project requirements

This risk occurs when the product owner presents the product/service requirements and the development team members do not understand what he really wants. This risk is directly related to the experience level of the professional responsible for business design, feature analysis, requirements gathering, and so on.

  - **Probability**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
  - **Impact**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH

## Loss of data or the requirements document

This risk occurs when the project requirements document is lost or doesn't cover the necessary data for the project's development.

  - **Probability**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
