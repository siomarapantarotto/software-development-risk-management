This repo outlines some aspects of risk management in software development projects. Be welcome to copy, modify, and apply them in your own work or business, as well as share them with whomever you consider necessary. 

## Objective

Reduce risks that are present in software development projects by identifying, analyzing, treating, and controlling them.

## Expected Results

- Improvement of the products and services developed

- Increased productivity of the product development process

- Deliveries on schedule

- etc...

## Main Activity

Incorporate risk management in the software development process, evaluate the results and propose improvements to the plan.

## Risk Management Process

- Communication and consultation

    // TODO: define ways of communication and consultation

- Establishing the context 

    // TODO: define contexts
    
- Risk identification

    // TODO: describe risks
    
- Risk analysis
   - Probability:
      - **VERY LOW**:   Unlikely. The event may even occur in exceptional situations, but the circumstances do not indicate this possibility.
      - **LOW**:        Rare. The event may occur unexpectedly or casually, as the circumstances indicate little of this possibility.
      - **MEDIUM**:     Possible. Event could occur in some way because circumstances moderately indicate this possibility.
      - **HIGH**:       Probable. The event can occur in an even expected way because circumstances strongly indicate this possibility.
      - **VERY HIGH**:  Almost certain. The event will certainly occur because the circumstances clearly indicate this possibility.

  - Impact:
      - **VERY LOW**: minimally compromises the achievement of the objective; for practical purposes, does not alter the achievement of the objective/result.
      - **LOW**: compromises the achievement of the objective to some extent, but does not prevent the achievement of most of the objective/result.
      - **MEDIUM**: reasonably compromises the achievement of the goal/outcome.
      - **HIGH**: Compromises most of the achievement of the objective/result.
      - **VERY HIGH**: totally or almost totally compromises the achievement of the of the objective/result.

- Risk assessment

    // TODO: defines ways of communication and consultation
    
- Risk treatment
      - Immediate actions
      - Preventive actions 
    
- Monitoring and critical analysis
