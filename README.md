This repo outlines some aspects of risk governance in software development projects.

Be welcome to copy, modify, and apply them in your own work or business, as well as share them with whomever you consider necessary. 

## Introduction

Risk control is vital to software development projects.

A project can be defined as a work that seeks the creation of a product or the execution of a service.

Whether it is a product or a service, all activities need to be planned, scheduled, and, when executed, need to be controlled.

Incorporate risk management in the software development process, evaluate the results and propose improvements to the plan is an important factor for the success or failure of any project.

## Risk Control Objectives

Operate in a preventive way, acting actively to reduce risks that are present in software development projects by identifying, analyzing, treating, and controlling them.

## Expected Results

- Improvement of the products and services developed.

- Increased productivity of the product development process.

- Deliveries on schedule.

- Reduction of losses.

- etc...

## Risk Management Process

The risk management process is a blueprint for the actions that need to be done. And there are five basic steps that are taken to manage the risk. These steps are commonly referred to as the risk management process. It begins with risk identification, advances to risk analysis, then the risk is prioritized, a solution is implemented, and finally, the risk is monitored.

So, these are the five essential steps of a risk management process:

Step 1: Identify the risk
Step 2: Analyze the risk
Step 3: Assess or classify the risk
Step 4: Treat the risk
Step 5: Monitor and review the risk

- **Communication and consultation**

    // TODO: define ways of communication and consultation

- **Establishing the context** 

    "By establishing the context, the firm articulates its objectives and defines the external and internal parameters to be taken into account when managing risk, and sets the scope and risk criteria for the remaining process." (AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009)
    
- **Risk identification**

    The identification of risks is a crucial step in effective risk management and needs to be comprehensive. If a potential risk is not identified at this stage, it will obviously be ignored in later analyses, implying possible disastrous consequences should it occur.
    
    All possible risks must be identified, even if they have never occurred.
    
- **Risk analysis**

  - **Risk response strategies:**

      - **Avoid**: eliminate the threat to protect the project from the impact of the risk.
        - Example: cancelling the project.
      - **Transfer**: shifts the impact of the threat to as third party, together with ownership of the response.
        - Example: contract insurance.
      - **Mitigate**: act to reduce the probability of occurrence or the impact of the risk.
        - Example: choose a different supplier.
      - **Accept**: acknowledge the risk, but do not take any action unless the risk occurs.
        - Example: document the risk and put aside funds in case the risk occurs.
  
   - **Probability:**
  
      - **VERY LOW**: UNLIKELY - The event may even occur in exceptional situations, but the circumstances do not indicate this possibility.
      - **LOW**: RARE - The event may occur unexpectedly or casually, as the circumstances indicate little of this possibility.
      - **MEDIUM**: POSSIBLE - Event could occur in some way because circumstances moderately indicate this possibility.
      - **HIGH**: PROBABLE - The event can occur in an even expected way because circumstances strongly indicate this possibility.
      - **VERY HIGH**: ALMOST CERTAIN - The event will certainly occur because the circumstances clearly indicate this possibility.

  - **Impact:**
  
      - **VERY LOW**: minimally compromises the achievement of the objective; for practical purposes, does not alter the achievement of the objective/result.
      - **LOW**: compromises the achievement of the objective to some extent, but does not prevent the achievement of most of the objective/result.
      - **MEDIUM**: reasonably compromises the achievement of the goal/outcome.
      - **HIGH**: Compromises most of the achievement of the objective/result.
      - **VERY HIGH**: totally or almost totally compromises the achievement of the of the objective/result.

- **Risk assessment**

  Risk assessment is the process of identifying potential hazards and analyzing what might happen if they occur.
    
- **Risk treatment**
  
  The market presents countless tools and services for risk control and treatment, but the truth is that not all companies can afford them.

  It is also true that many companies experiencing growth, with little or no profit, are unlikely to stop investing in their primary activities in order to invest in risk control.

  It is the reality of each company that will define if risk control will be delegated to specialists or implemented by its own members through the development and execution of an action plan, which can be immediate or preventive.

  These are actions already thought out, discussed, and assigned to the risk, even if the risk has never occurred. This is not an exhaustive list, because new actions may be suggested at any moment. Hence the importance of the constant revision of the risk management plan.    

    - **Immediate actions:** These are actions that should be implemented immediately when the risk occurs. 
  
    - **Preventive actions:** These are actions that should be constantly implemented aiming at the prevention of risk occurrence.
    
- Monitoring and critical analysis

    The revision of the risk treatment plan is fundamental because even if a risk does not present immediate or preventive actions at a certain moment does not mean that it will not present them at another moment. 

    
## Risk Suggestion List

## Misunderstood project requirements

This risk occurs when the product owner presents the product/service requirements and the development team members do not understand what he really wants. This risk is directly related to the experience level of the professional responsible for business design, feature analysis, requirements gathering, and so on.

  - **Probability**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
  - **Impact**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
  - **Immediate Actions**: Check if there is any backup in case it has been lost.

  Start documenting the requirements that have already been implemented as well as the ones that have not yet been implemented.
  - **Preventive Actions**: Define and adopt rules to secure the document against loss and prevent project development from starting without this document having been minimally prepared. 

## Poorly crafted requirements document

This risk occurs when the project requirements document doesn't cover the necessary data for the project's development.

  - **Probability**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
  - **Impact**: VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH
  - **Immediate Actions**: TODO
  - **Preventive Actions**: TODO
