This repo outlines some aspects of risk management in software development projects.

## Objective

Reduce risks that are present in software development projects by identifying, analyzing, treating, and controlling them.

## Expected Results

- improvement of the products and services developed

- increased productivity of the product development process

- deliveries on schedule

- etc...

## Main Activity

Incorporate risk management in the software development process, evaluate the results and propose improvements to the plan.

## Risk Management Process

- Communication and consultation

- Establishing the context

- Risk identification

- Risk analysis
   - Probability:
      - Very low:   Unlikely. The event may even occur in exceptional situations, but the circumstances do not indicate this possibility.
      - Low:        Rare. The event may occur unexpectedly or casually, as the circumstances indicate little of this possibility.
      - Medium:     Possible. Event could occur in some way because circumstances moderately indicate this possibility.
      - High:       Probable. The event can occur in an even expected way because circumstances strongly indicate this possibility.
      - Very High:  Almost certain. The event will certainly occur because the circumstances clearly indicate this possibility.

    TODO ...to be continued

- Risk assessment

- Immediate/preventive actions 

- Monitoring and critical analysis
